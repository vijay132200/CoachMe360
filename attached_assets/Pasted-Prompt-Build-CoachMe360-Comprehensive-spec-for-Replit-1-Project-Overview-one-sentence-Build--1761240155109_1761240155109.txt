Prompt — Build CoachMe360 (Comprehensive spec for Replit)
1) Project Overview (one sentence)

Build CoachMe360 — a web application that helps managers discover blind spots (self vs 360 feedback), build emotional intelligence, practice feedback, track progress with data, run team pulse checks, and practice leadership via AI-driven simulations.
All AI/NLP/ML features must use Gemini API; for other features, use any libraries or platforms as desired.
Users can access and use the app directly — no sign-in or profile creation required.

2) Core Objectives & Value

Provide clear visual evidence of self–other gaps (Johari/Dunning–Kruger problem).

Give practical coaching micro-actions grounded in OB theory (GROW, SBI, LMX, Path-Goal).

Produce measurable progress with dashboards and KPIs HR can use.

Offer AI-powered summaries, role-play simulations, sentiment & risk scoring via Gemini.

3) Must-have Features (priority order)
A. Roles & Permissions

Roles: Admin (HR), Manager (subject), Peer/Direct report (feedback giver), Mentor/Coach (internal/external).

Permissions: anonymous feedback submission allowed; managers can view aggregated results only.

B. Organization Setup

Org structure: departments and teams; admins can create manager records.

No personal account or sign-in required — users can directly participate and submit feedback.

C. Self-assessment & 360° Feedback

Self-assessment form (Likert 1–10) across a configurable set of competencies (EI, Empathy, Coaching, Communication, Empowerment, Commitment, Problem-solving, etc.).

360 feedback submission occurs directly on the Feedback Page: employees (peers/direct reports) submit feedback on the same page (no email invites). The page supports multiple anonymous submissions so many colleagues can add feedback one after another without leaving the page.

Each employee must also provide short feedback lines (1–2 sentences) alongside each rating — e.g., “Sometimes dismisses new ideas before discussion” or “Encourages open sharing in team meetings.”

After results are collected, Gemini analyzes both quantitative gaps (ratings shown on radar/line charts) and qualitative insights (feedback lines) to highlight discrepancies between the manager’s self-perception and team perception.

Gemini then generates suggestions for the manager’s development rooted in HR and Organizational Behavior theories such as Johari Window, GROW, Path-Goal, and SBI.

Anonymous option clearly presented; the system must preserve anonymity and not link submissions to identities unless explicit opt-in.

D. Visualization & Reports

Radar chart comparing self vs 360 (interactive).

Trend lines for scores over time (line charts).

Downloadable PDF summary reports for managers & HR.

E. PulseEngage (Team Pulse)

Short weekly check-in (3 Qs by default: listened-to, workload fairness, manager helpfulness).

Anonymous aggregation and trend visualization.

F. EQ Mirror & Reflection Journal

Daily/weekly journaling prompts (3 prompts).

Sentiment analysis + emotional tone timeline (AI-driven).

Private to user but summary trends feed manager coaching plan if user opts in.

G. Coaching Workflows (GROW + SBI)

Guided module to create GROW goals per direct report.

Built-in templates for SBI feedback messages; save and reuse.

Task list for behavioural experiments (implementation intentions) with reminders and owner assignments.

H. Feedback Buddy (Practice & Role-play)

AI-driven role-play: manager practices delivering feedback; AI plays the direct report and responds realistically. (Gemini)

AI evaluates use of SBI, tone, and suggests improvements (concrete lines).

I. LeadLab — Simulations & Gamification

Short gamified scenarios where manager choices change team morale/performance metrics.

Each scenario explains theory (Path-Goal, Transformational) and suggests learning points.

J. AI Features (REQUIRED: Gemini API)

360 Summary & Gap Analysis: Gemini interprets both the numeric rating differences and qualitative feedback lines to pinpoint blind spots, communication barriers, and empathy gaps.

Action Suggestion Engine: When major perception gaps exist, Gemini provides practical improvement advice (e.g., active listening, delegation, coaching posture) grounded in theories like GROW, LMX, Path-Goal, and Emotional Intelligence.

Role-play & Coaching Evaluation: Real-time simulation and feedback scoring.

Sentiment & Emotion Analysis: On journals, meeting transcripts, and open feedback.

Derailment Risk Prediction: Detect early warning signs from negative sentiment, low feedback consistency, or deteriorating 360 trends.

Meeting Summaries (optional): Upload transcript → AI summary + suggested follow-ups.

All NLP/LLM tasks must use Gemini API with retries, rate limits, and graceful fallback.

K. Integrations & Notifications

Optional email or Slack reminders for pulse and micro-action nudges (not required for submission).

Calendar integration for scheduling coaching sessions.

L. Admin & HR Dashboard

View aggregated leadership metrics by team/department.

Export CSV/PDF.

Configure competency list, thresholds for action, and promotion gating rules.

4) Non-Functional Requirements

Security: store data securely; use HTTPS; role-based permissions for admins.

Privacy: all feedback is anonymous; no user account creation required.

Scalability: design to support hundreds of simultaneous sessions.

UX: minimal friction — instant access, mobile responsive, feedback takes <2 minutes.

Testing: unit tests for backend, integration tests for AI flows (mock Gemini).

Observability: basic logging, error tracking, and usage analytics.

5) Data Model (suggested)

(Retained but without user login fields)

Manager: id, name, dept, role
SelfAssessment: id, manager_id, responses{competency:score}, created_at
Feedback: id, manager_id, responses{competency:score}, comments_text, created_at
Pulse: id, team_id, responses{}, created_at
JournalEntry: id, manager_id, text, sentiment_score, emotion_tags, created_at
GROWGoal: id, manager_id, goal, reality, options, will, progress_notes[]
AIAnalysis: id, source_type, source_id, summary, themes[], sentiment, created_at

6) Gemini Integration — Guidance

Use Gemini API for:

Summarizing feedback text

Extracting themes and emotional tone

Analyzing self–other rating gaps

Generating micro-actions tied to HR/OB theory

7) UI Pages / Wireframe (minimum)

Home / Dashboard

Dashboard (Manager View): radar chart, trends, pulse snapshot

Self Assessment Page

Feedback Page: inline feedback submission form that accepts multiple anonymous submissions on the same page (no email invites)

Report Page: 360 summary, AI themes, action items

Pulse Page: team pulse history

Journal Page: reflection + sentiment timeline

Role-play / Feedback Buddy Page: chat UI (Gemini)

Simulations / LeadLab Page: scenarios & outcomes

Admin / HR Dashboard: templates, exports, thresholds

Settings Page: integrations, notification preferences

8) Acceptance Criteria (deliverables)

9) Sample Test Data (for dev & QA)

Manager: Darcy Gallagher (mgr_001)

Team: Alice, Bob, Cathy

Self-assessment: EI=9, Coaching=8, Empathy=9, Communication=5

360 Feedback: Alice (EI=3, Coaching=2), Bob (EI=4), Cathy (EI=3)

Pulse responses (week1): listened=40%, workload=60%, manager_help=33%
Expected: Radar shows large gap; Gemini summary = “low empathy,” “directive style,” “improve listening.”

10) UX Copy / Example Messages

Week 2: Visualization (Radar, Pulse trends)

Week 3: Gemini integration for summaries & sentiment

Week 4: Role-play, GROW, Admin dashboards

Week 5: Testing, polish, deployment on Replit

13) Developer Notes / Constraints

Must use Gemini API for all AI/NLP tasks.

For other components, free to use any frameworks or libraries (React, Vue, Flask, Django, Express, Chart.js, etc.).

Respect privacy — never send PII to Gemini unless sanitized and approved.

Modularize Gemini calls (service layer) for easy replacement.

Include clear error handling, retries, and offline fallback.

14) Example Acceptance Test (AI Flow)

Upload 20 open-ended feedback comments (mixed tone).

Trigger “AI Summarize 360.”

Expect JSON output:
{ strengths:[3], development_areas:[3], themes:[3], actions:[5], sentiment_score:-0.2 }
Display as readable report.

15) Final Notes for Replit / Developer

Include a README with environment setup, how to set GEMINI_API_KEY, run local tests, and mock Gemini.

Implement logging, rate-limiting, and graceful degradation if AI is unavailable.

Design must be intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly.
