# Vercel Deployment Guide for CoachMe360

## Quick Fix for Blank White Screen

If you're seeing a blank white screen, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify Build Settings in Vercel

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
3. Scroll to **Build & Development Settings**
4. Configure as follows:
   - **Framework Preset**: `Other` (or `Vite`)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. **For static demo mode (recommended first):**
   - Remove `VITE_API_BASE_URL` if it exists
   - Or leave it empty
3. **For full functionality with backend:**
   - Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend URL
   - Example: `https://your-backend.railway.app`

### Step 3: Clear Cache and Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find your latest deployment
3. Click the **three dots** (...) menu
4. Select **Redeploy**
5. ‚úÖ **Check "Use existing Build Cache"** to UNCHECK it (clear cache)
6. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Check Browser Console

While the deployment is running:

1. Open your Vercel deployment URL
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Look for errors (red text)

Common errors and solutions:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"` | Output directory is wrong. Should be `dist/public` |
| `404` errors for `/assets/*.js` | Build didn't complete. Check build logs |
| `Uncaught TypeError` or React errors | Clear cache and redeploy |
| Nothing loads at all | Check Network tab for 404 on `index.html` |

### Step 5: Verify Build Logs

1. In Vercel, click on the deployment
2. View the **Build Logs**
3. Look for:
   ```
   ‚úì built in XXs
   ```
4. Ensure no errors appear

## Vercel Configuration File

Your project includes a `vercel.json` file with the correct configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Do not modify this file** unless you know what you're doing.

## Testing Locally Before Deploying

To ensure your build works before deploying to Vercel:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the built files with a local server
cd dist/public
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

If it works locally but not on Vercel, the issue is with Vercel configuration.

## Node.js Version

Ensure Vercel is using Node.js 20 or higher:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under **Node.js Version**, select `20.x`
3. Redeploy

## Static Demo Mode

When deployed without a backend:

- ‚úÖ You can view all pages and demo data
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows charts and statistics
- ‚úÖ All navigation works
- ‚ùå Submit buttons are disabled (read-only mode)
- ‚ùå No AI features (requires backend with GEMINI_API_KEY)

## Full Functionality Mode

To enable AI features and data submission:

1. Deploy your Express backend separately:
   - **Replit**: Use the built-in deployment
   - **Railway**: `railway up`
   - **Render**: Connect your repo
   - **Fly.io**: `fly deploy`

2. Set environment variables in Vercel:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   ```

3. Redeploy

The app will automatically detect the backend and enable all features.

## Still Having Issues?

### Debug Checklist

- [ ] Build command is `npm run build`
- [ ] Output directory is `dist/public`
- [ ] Node.js version is 20.x
- [ ] No `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable (for static mode)
- [ ] Cleared build cache
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors
- [ ] Verified `vercel.json` exists in project root
- [ ] Build logs show successful completion

### Get Help

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any warnings or errors
2. **Browser Console**: Open DevTools and check Console/Network tabs
3. **Vercel Functions**: This is a static site, ensure no serverless functions are being created
4. **Fresh Deploy**: Try deploying from a new commit

### Common Solutions

**Problem**: Blank white screen
**Solution**: Usually a build configuration issue. Double-check output directory is `dist/public`

**Problem**: 404 on all routes except home
**Solution**: `vercel.json` rewrites not working. Ensure the file exists in project root

**Problem**: Assets not loading
**Solution**: Build didn't complete successfully. Check build logs and try clearing cache

**Problem**: Data not showing
**Solution**: Check that `dist/public/data/` contains JSON files after build

## Success Indicators

When deployment is successful, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
2. ‚úÖ Deployment shows "Ready" status
3. ‚úÖ Opening the URL shows the CoachMe360 dashboard
4. ‚úÖ Navigation between pages works
5. ‚úÖ Charts and data are visible
6. ‚úÖ No errors in browser console

If all these are true, your deployment is successful! üéâ
